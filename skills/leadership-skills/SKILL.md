# Leadership & Specialized Skills

## Quick Start

Begin your leadership journey:

### Effective 1-on-1 Meetings
```markdown
## 1-on-1 Meeting Structure (30 minutes)

### Preparation (5 min before)
- Review previous notes
- Prepare 1-2 discussion topics
- Have context on current work

### Meeting (25 minutes)
**Employee First (10 min)**
- How are you doing?
- Any blockers or concerns?
- What's your biggest challenge?

**Manager Topics (10 min)**
- Feedback (positive and constructive)
- Career development
- Goals and progress
- Team updates

**Wrap-up (5 min)**
- Action items
- Next meeting time
- Questions?

### Follow-up
- Document decisions
- Send action items
- Follow up on previous items
```

### Product Prioritization Framework
```markdown
## RICE Scoring for Feature Prioritization

**Reach**: How many users affected per quarter?
- Scale: 1-10

**Impact**: How much does it change for affected users?
- 3 = Massive, 2 = High, 1 = Medium, 0.5 = Low, 0.25 = Minimal

**Confidence**: How confident are you in estimates?
- 100% = High, 75% = Medium, 50% = Low

**Effort**: How many person-months to implement?
- Weeks to months

**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

Example:
- Reach: 10,000 users
- Impact: 2x (high)
- Confidence: 75%
- Effort: 3 months
- Score = (10,000 × 2 × 0.75) / 3 = 5,000
```
