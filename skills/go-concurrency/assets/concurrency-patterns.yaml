# Go Concurrency Patterns

patterns:
  worker_pool:
    description: Fixed number of goroutines processing jobs
    use_case: CPU-bound tasks, rate limiting
    components: [jobs channel, results channel, WaitGroup]

  fan_out_fan_in:
    description: Multiple workers, merged results
    use_case: Parallel processing with aggregation
    components: [multiple input channels, single output]

  pipeline:
    description: Series of stages connected by channels
    use_case: Data transformation workflows
    components: [generator, processors, consumer]

  semaphore:
    description: Limit concurrent access
    use_case: Resource limiting
    components: [buffered channel]

  pub_sub:
    description: Publisher broadcasts to subscribers
    use_case: Event distribution
    components: [topic channels, subscriber registry]

synchronization:
  - sync.Mutex: Exclusive access
  - sync.RWMutex: Multiple readers, single writer
  - sync.WaitGroup: Wait for goroutines
  - sync.Once: Run exactly once
  - sync.Cond: Conditional wait
  - sync.Pool: Object reuse
